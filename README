      Release: 2.0 (1998/8/24)
Compatibility: R3
     Location: contrib/gfx
  Description: BeDVI is a DVI viewer based on xdvi.
        Notes: o BeDVI requires an installed unixtex distribution.
               o BeDVI requires libprefs.
               o BeDVI may be distributed according to the GNU Public License (see COPYING).


Installing BeDVI
================

There are two versions of BeDVI and DVIHandler included. The normal version has GhostScript
support and therefor needs the GhostScript library libgs.so, the other version (`BeDVI-no.gs'
and `DVIHandler-no.gs') can be used without this library.

BeDVI needs the following libraries:

  o libprefs.so version 1.23 (libprefs distribution)

  o libkpathsea.so version 3.1 (unixtex distribution)

The full version additionaly needs:

  o libgs.so version 5.03 (GhostScript distribution)

Copy the file `DVIHandler' (or `DVIHandler-no.gs') to `~/config/add-ons/Translators/'.

BeDVI searches for TeX fonts in the directories `/var/tex/fonts/pk' and
`/boot/apps/GeekGadgets/share/texmf/fonts/pk'. Font files aren't included in this archive. They
can be found in the unxitex distribution for BeOS or at any CTAN site.


Uninstalling BeDVI
==================

Delete the program itself, `~/config/add-ons/Translators/DVIHandler' and the directory
`/boot/home/config/settings/_LP_x-vnd.blume-BeDVI/'. If there are no other programs using
libprefs.so, libgs.so and libkpathsea.so, those libraries can also be deleted.


Localization
============

If you have `mwbres' you can change the menu titles by copying one of the `Menu.data-<Language>'
files to `Menu.data' and running the command `make localize'.

 $ cp Menu.data-deutsch Menu.data
 $ make localize

Alternatively you can use a resource editor to edit the resouce `BeDVI:Menu.data' directly.


Using BeDVI
===========

Commandline options:

  BeDVI [-v<log-level>] [<files> ...]

The option -v can be used to specify the verbosity of BeDVI's error messages which are
written to the file /var/log/syslog. The <log-level> can be any number from 0 (no logging)
to 5 (full logging).
